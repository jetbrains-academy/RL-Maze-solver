title: Reinforcement Learning Maze Solver
language: English
summary: "<p>This is an introductory Reinforcement Learning tutorial by JetBrains\
  \ Academy demonstrating the approach on a simple task of solving a labyrinth.</p>\
  \ \n<p>You will implement a simple Q-learning algorithm that uses rewards and penalties\
  \ and an iteratively updated Q-table to teach a learning agent find the shortest\
  \ path through a 2D maze.  You will get acquainted with the key concepts of RL and\
  \ learn what kinds of problems such algorithms can be applied to and what limitations\
  \ they carry.</p> \n<p>The course includes building a dynamic visualization of the\
  \ agent moving through the maze.</p>\n"
