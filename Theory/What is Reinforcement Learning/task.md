## What is Reinforcement Learning

[Reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning) (RL) is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, 
alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.

The key RL concept is learning by interaction.
The model learns from interactions with an environment to 
maximize a reward function.
As opposed to supervised learning, correct labels for learning a series of actions are not known upfront, 
they need to be learned through interactions with the environment. It also does not 
require sub-optimal actions to be explicitly corrected.
We do not teach an agent how to do things; we can only specify what 
we want the agent to achieve. The focus is on finding a
balance between exploration (of uncharted territory) and exploitation
(of current knowledge).
