### What this course is about
This tutorial is going to guide you step by step through building a simple Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm
to solve a 2D maze in the shortest number of steps.
You will get acquainted with the key concepts of RL and learn what kinds of problems such algorithms can be applied to and what limitations they carry.
You will implement a Q-learning algorithm that uses rewards and penalties and an iteratively updated Q-table to teach a learning agent 
to find the shortest path through a maze. The course also includes building a dynamic visualization of the agent moving through the maze.

### Prerequisites
To get the most out of this course, you will need to have some knowledge of the following:

- Good understanding of Python syntax, data structures, classes and objects, etc.
- Fair understanding of NumPy arrays and operations on them.
- Basic math, being able to read and understand formulas.

It might also be fun to take the [AMazing](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17519-amazing) course fist. There we explore building the kind of maze that we will solve in this course.

If you believe your Python or NumPy skills to be insufficient, we encourage you to take [Introduction to Python](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/16630-introduction-to-python) 
and/or [Python Libraries â€“ NumPy](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18302-python-libraries--numpy) course first.
