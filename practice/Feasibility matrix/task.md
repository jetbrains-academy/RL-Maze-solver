### Task

In the file convert.py, complete the definition of the `__init__` method of class Feasibility.
You will need to define two attributes. The first one, numbered_grid, should be a numpy array of the same shape as the maze grid and
containing the numbers of all cells in the grid
(for example, for a 3x3 grid it would be an array `[[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8]]`).
The second one, F_matrix, should for now just be an array of zeroes of shape nxn where n in the number of cells in the grid.
For example, for a 3x3 maze, this would be an array of zeroes of shape (9, 9).
