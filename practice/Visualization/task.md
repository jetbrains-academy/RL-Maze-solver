You can now add the following line to the `main` block in `final_run.py`
and run the code in order to see a gif showing how 
the agent moves through your labyrinth! 

```python
  make_movie(maze, feasibility, agent.path)
```

You will also need to import this function from `draw.py`.
This module contains some drawing functions we predefined for you to create a visualization for this tutorial.
If you're interested how it works â€“ go ahead and study the code!

You can see the gif if you go to the next task after running the code here,
or you can open it in a browser :)
