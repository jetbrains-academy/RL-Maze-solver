# Reinforcement Learning Maze Solver course [![official JetBrains project](http://jb.gg/badges/official.svg)](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/ALL/JetBrains+on+GitHub)
  <p>This is an introductory Reinforcement Learning tutorial by JetBrains Academy demonstrating the approach on a simple task of solving a labyrinth.</p> 
  <p>You will implement a simple Q-learning algorithm that uses rewards and penalties and an iteratively updated Q-table to teach a learning agent find the shortest path through a 2D maze.  You will get acquainted with the key concepts of RL and learn what kinds of problems such algorithms can be applied to and what limitations they carry.</p> 
  <p>The course includes building a dynamic visualization of the agent moving through the maze.</p>

  <p>Have fun and good luck!</p>
